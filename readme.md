## The files are related to single object tracking for an UAV database system
### The dataset links are
1. UAV123 - https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ivul/uav123
2. DTB70 - https://github.com/flyers/drone-tracking
3. VisDrone2019-SOT - https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset

The python scritps have the naming convention for trackers combining components [kalman, CF, Homography].

For E.g. - A script named - "**CF_tracker_with_KALMAN_and_detection**.py" mean, it is using **DCF tracker** + **Kalman filter position estimation** + **Object detector**.

Note - file paths for datasets downloaded should be changed as per the system on which the scripts are ran.

### For evaluation of the data generated by the tracker scritps - pysot-toolkit has been used as given below - 
#### PySOT Toolkit- https://github.com/StrangerZhang/pysot-toolkit

### Prerequisites
1. ROS should be installed in the system - ROS installation guide - http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation
2. Reference for KCF tracker python implementation can be tested from - https://github.com/topics/kcf-tracker (just to check how it working)
3. Reference for CDR-DCF tracker can be tested from - https://github.com/alanlukezic/csr-dcf (just to check how it works)
